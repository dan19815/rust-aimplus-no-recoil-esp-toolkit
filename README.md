## 🦾 Advanced Functions Explained

### Adaptive Interface  
The interface isn't static. Thanks to OpenAI and Claude, elements reorganize or simplify depending on your focus—allowing for distraction-free immersion, whether setting up before a tense firefight or adjusting settings on the fly.

### Contextual Aimbot  
Standard aimbots are blunt. Ours evaluates engagement range, opponent movement, and your current weapon, adapting its assistance so it feels as natural as your next heartbeat.

### ESP Customization  
Not every player wants clutter! Toggle between loot, enemy, and landmark highlights. ESP overlays utilize subtle, colorblind-friendly palettes and provide warnings based on line-of-sight vulnerability.

### Multi-Profile Quick Switch  
Heading from a solo match into a team battle? Change your support profiles instantly, with AI suggestions based on your gameplay style throughout 2025's meta.
